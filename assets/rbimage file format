Ideas for the format of the rbimage file.  The rbimage file is going to be used to store file data.

raw binary?  Data about where files begin/end can be stored in the database?

database is backed up regularly, possibly after every change, to ALL storage nodes and stored in
encrypted format.  The KEY is needed to re-import the file.  Import is a destructive process, erasing the current
database.  This allows multiple copies of the file data to exist, without keeping a copy in the raw data store itself.

The data store can store the encrypted data manually. (Need a receive function in NetIOHandler that bypasses decryption)

Data File would be un-readable if encrypted, without the key.

rbimage file limit needs to be set to something sane.  Testing will need to be done.  The limit is more of a
"past this limit, make a new file on next file" so image files could grow beyond the limit if backing up a single file
bigger than that limit.  The idea is that whole files are always stored in the same rbimage.  A single backed up file
never spans more than 1 rbimage file.
